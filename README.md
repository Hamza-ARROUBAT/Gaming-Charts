<h1 align="center">Think-it Web Challenge - Junior <br/> (Gaming Charts)</h1>

# Introduction

As you wished 😉👍🏼 <br/>
`Gaming Charts` is a React SPA that enables the user to search for the top games by playtime or by number of unique users.
The application consists of two components:

- A backend that serves the data to the frontend
- A frontend that consumes the endpoints exposed by the backend and displays the data to the user.

You will find in each folder (frontend/backend), a README file that gives details about how to lunch the servers to run the Web-App on your machines 💻🎉

# Technologies

In this part i will explain why i choosed each technology of this project.

## React

React one the most used libraries of Javascript, we can actually concider it a Framework because of all the libraries that we can use with, so it's a big ecosystem that makes React one of the best Framework for building SPA.

All my experience building Full Stack Web Apps, so i'm most confortable with it.

## axios

Axios is a Javascript library used to make requests and recieve responses, it supports the Promise API wich make it really easy to use in comparaison of native Http/XMLHttp requests.

## styled-components

styled-components allows to write CSS code to style for each component separtly or globaly. It uses SASS syntaxe so it really nice and easy to use.
One the most reason of using this library is the fact that you can pass components props and use them into the styles, wich make it really efficient in time and efforts consuming.

## styled-icons

An icon library that delivers SVG icons from diffrent sources (material-icons, bootstrap, Font Awesome...) to use with react. And I prefer using it because of it's icons syntax made with styled components so we can easly style them.

## Material-UI

Material-UI is a React component library that makes the development faster and easier with the pre-maded components that can just import and integrate in our Apps.

## Node.js

Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
I really like Node.js and all of it's ecosystem libraries because it mades it very easy to build complex apps that normally should take double amount of effort with other frameworks.

## Express.js

It's a javascript framework that provides a lot of HTTP utility methods and middleware at our disposal, making building a robust API quick and easy.

## Lodash

it's a JavaScript library which provides utility functions for almost all common programming tasks.
It is also very performant, so i tend to use it when i can.

## cors

Cross is a Http mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources.
So i used it to make the communication between the front and back possible.

## dotenv

Environment variables are always needed to make the code more maintainable and more secure, and there are easy to set up with Dotenv wich automatically loads environment variables from a .env file into the process.env object.

#### ---> A last word : This project was really exiting to make, i just wanted to say a biiig "Thank you ♥" to Think-it and it's recrutement team. Your breakthrough recruitment process will surely make you one of the best companies ✨.
